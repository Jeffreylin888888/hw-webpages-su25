### Part 1

- In my path tracer, rays are generated from the camera using its intrinsic properties (like the field of view) and resolution. For each pixel on the image plane, I compute a direction vector from the camera center through that pixel using the camera-to-world transformation. This gives me the primary ray for that pixel, and I cast that into the scene to look for intersections. Once a ray is fired, it traverses the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH), which accelerates the search for potential geometry intersections. If a BVH node’s bounding box is hit, I descend recursively; otherwise, that entire subtree is skipped. When I reach a leaf node, I test the ray against the actual geometry (triangles, spheres, etc.) inside. If I find the closest intersection, I store the hit point, surface normal, and material info for shading.
