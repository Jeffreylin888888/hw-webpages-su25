We have all the write-up there, and we screenshotted them into this github webpage.

It took us around 40 hours to get through all six questions. 

Overview: For this project, we implemented a complete geometry processing pipeline using the half-edge data structure. We began by writing de Casteljauâ€™s algorithm in both 2D and 3D to evaluate BÃ©zier curves and surfaces, returning intermediate points at each level and ultimately the final evaluated point. We then implemented the surface evaluation for a BÃ©zier patch by applying de Casteljauâ€™s algorithm twice â€” once along the rows and then along the resulting column. Next, we computed per-vertex normals using area-weighted triangle normals around the one-ring neighborhood to get smooth shading. For mesh manipulation, we implemented edge flipping by carefully rewiring the local half-edge structure, and edge splitting by inserting a new vertex, creating six new half-edges and three new edges, and updating all connectivity. Finally, we completed Loop subdivision in the upsample function, which performs a full subdivision pass: updating vertex positions using the Loop formula, splitting all original edges, flipping edges connecting old and new vertices to maintain regularity, and updating vertex positions. The result is a progressively smoother surface that reflects the structure of Loop subdivision. Throughout the implementation, we carefully tracked and maintained mesh connectivity while ensuring each step followed the rules of the half-edge data structure.
